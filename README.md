DBMS PROJECT
Railway Management System
Problem statement: The railway network of our country is one of
the most complex public establishments. We can design a
database solution for this network and make the management of
the same more natural. Our system should have the following
pieces of information:
• Train status table
• Train
• Train Class
• Route (to keep things simple, we can assume that only one track runs between two stations)
• Stations
• Passengers
• Users (for online booking)
• Books(To show bookings made by users)
